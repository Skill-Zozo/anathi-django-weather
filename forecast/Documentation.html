This is the documentation of the weather website that I have developed using python and the django framework.
As far as programming is consend I have never used the django framework but there are no limits in this programming ship.
Given the short time period given I think I gave my best.
As for the code I did everything required of me except displaying the weather using the jason format, because this had a deadline I could not
get my head around it on time, as a result, this website page displays the roar data from the website not displayed in a pleasant manner at all.

The admin page is created and it enables the adminstartor to see the number of users registered and has the authority to remove any of the users.

I have used html, css,js,bootstramp to sstructure the page a little bit. You will encount some "jinja" on the pages. I also just learnt about it 
on the space.

the admin username is : Admin, password : Ya940211


***test***
these are some of the users that I created.

username : anathi@uin.poi
password : lol

if you log in as an admin, you can see all of the accounts created, you can also create yours
and check the display on the admin page or alternatively acces the sqlite3 database directly.

Before this, my experience was purely on python, I learnt, and it was a nice experience.
